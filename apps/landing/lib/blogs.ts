      <strong><i>As 2025 begins, the Zidallie team is filled with excitement and purpose. Looking back on 2024, weâ€™re proud of the milestones we achieved in revolutionizing school transportation, and weâ€™re energized by the journey ahead.</i></strong><br /><br />

    <strong>Reflecting on 2024: A Year of Growth and Impact</strong><br /><br />
    Last year, Zidallie successfully transported thousands of students, ensuring safety and reliability every step of the way. Beyond providing a ride to school, we created meaningful economic opportunities for hundreds of drivers, empowering them and their families.<br /><br />

    We also received invaluable support from notable funders like the 54 Collective Entrepreneur Program and Stanchart Bankâ€™s Women in Tech Program. Their backing played a significant role in enabling our growth and success, further reinforcing our belief in the power of collaboration.<br /><br />

    <strong>Expanding Horizons: New Routes for Better Access</strong><br /><br />
    This year, Zidallie has set an ambitious goal: to make all schools in Nairobi carpool-enabled. By introducing new routes across the city, we aim to ensure every school has access to efficient, reliable, and safe carpool options. This initiative is designed to:<br />
    - Reduce commute times and traffic congestion.<br />
    - Provide affordable transport solutions for parents.<br />
    - Strengthen community ties through shared rides.<br /><br />
    
    Every new route we establish brings us closer to this vision, ensuring that more families can rely on Zidallie for their school transportation needs.<br /><br />

    <strong>Inclusive Transport: A Commitment to Every Child</strong><br /><br />
    Inclusivity is central to Zidallieâ€™s values. In 2025, we are thrilled to introduce vehicles designed to meet the needs of children with special needs. This initiative includes:<br />
    - Vehicles equipped with wheelchair ramps, secure seating, and other accessibility features.<br />
    - Childminders trained to provide care and support for children with diverse needs.<br />
    - Flexible and customized routes to accommodate families requiring specialized transport.<br /><br />
    
    We believe transportation should never be a barrier to education, and weâ€™re taking concrete steps to ensure every childâ€™s journey is safe, comfortable, and empowering.<br /><br />

    <strong>Collaboration for Impact</strong><br /><br />
    Our work would not be possible without the support of schools, parents, and vehicle partners. In 2025, we aim to deepen these collaborations to create seamless transport experiences tailored to the unique needs of each community.<br /><br />

    Additionally, Zidallie is investing in advanced technology to enhance our real-time tracking systems, ensuring transparency and peace of mind for both parents and schools.<br /><br />

    <strong>Looking Ahead</strong><br /><br />
    2025 marks a new chapter for Zidallie. As we expand, innovate, and prioritize inclusivity, our commitment to excellence remains unwavering. This is more than transportationâ€”itâ€™s about creating opportunities, fostering trust, and making a lasting difference.<br /><br />

    Join us on this exciting journey as we make 2025 a year of growth, inclusion, and progress.<br /><br />
    
    <strong>Happy New Year from all of us at Zidallie. ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ†</strong><br /><br />

      <strong><i>Imagine a future where every child in Kenya reaches school safely, on time, and ready to learn.
      Zidallie is making that vision a reality, one ride at a time.</i></strong><br /><br />
  
      <strong>The Current Landscape of School Transport in Kenya</strong><br /><br />
      In Kenya, the journey to school is more than just a daily commuteâ€”itâ€™s a lifeline, a gateway to education, and a critical component of a childâ€™s well-being. Yet, for many families, school transport poses a host of challenges, including safety concerns, inconsistent schedules, and affordability issues.<br /><br />
      At Zidallie, weâ€™re stepping up to transform school transportation in Kenya, addressing these challenges with innovative, practical solutions that resonate with the realities of Kenyan families.<br /><br />
      
      <strong>The Current Landscape of School Transport in Kenya</strong><br />
      Across the country, school transport paints a complex picture. In urban areas, private vans and buses are common, but they often come at a steep price, limiting access for many families. Meanwhile, in rural areas, children frequently walk long distances or rely on informal means of transport like motorbikes, exposing them to significant risks.<br /><br />
  
      <strong>Safety Concerns</strong><br />
      For parents, ensuring their childrenâ€™s safety during the daily commute is non-negotiable. However, many existing transport services fall short, plagued by overcrowding, poorly maintained vehicles, and drivers with inadequate training.<br /><br />
  
      <strong>The Affordability Dilemma</strong><br />
      Private transport options, though reliable, remain out of reach for many families due to high costs. Public transport, while more affordable, often lacks the consistency and reliability necessary for school routines.<br /><br />
  
    
      <strong>How Zidallie is Changing the Game</strong><br /><br />
      Our vision is simple yet impactful: to create a safe, reliable, and inclusive school transport system that works for all Kenyan families. Hereâ€™s how weâ€™re making it happen:<br /><br />
  
      <strong>Innovative Technology</strong><br />
      With features like real-time tracking, instant notifications, and tailored scheduling, Zidallie empowers parents with tools to stay connected and informed. Schools benefit from streamlined operations, ensuring no child is left behind.<br /><br />
  
      <strong>Safety First</strong><br />
      Every Zidallie driver undergoes comprehensive training, and our vehicles are rigorously inspected to meet the highest safety standards. For us, safety isnâ€™t just a promiseâ€”itâ€™s the foundation of what we do.<br /><br />
  
      <strong>Affordable Solutions</strong><br />
      By collaborating with schools, parents, and strategic partners, Zidallie is working to make high-quality school transport accessible to all, balancing affordability with unmatched reliability.<br /><br />
  
      <strong>Equity and Improved Learning Outcomes</strong><br />
      When children can travel to school safely, on time, and without stress, theyâ€™re better prepared to learn. Zidallieâ€™s mission goes beyond transportation; weâ€™re driving equity and better educational outcomes across Kenya, one ride at a time.<br /><br />

      At Zidallie, we believe that school transportation is more than just a ride, it's a vital connection between home and school that shapes a child's daily experience. By integrating parents into this journey, we're not only enhancing safety and convenience but also strengthening the relationship between families and schools.<br /><br />

      Building a Partnership: Parents at the Heart of School Transport<br /><br />

      Parents are central to ensuring that their children enjoy a safe, reliable, and enjoyable journey to school. We proudly take parents through every step, with tools and features that keep them informed, engaged, and confident.<br /><br />

      Key Features That Bring Parents Closer to Their Children's Journey.<br /><br />

      <strong>Real-Time Tracking for Peace of Mind </strong>
      Our innovative tracking feature enables parents to monitor their child's journey in real time. With live updates and precise location tracking, parents can rest assured knowing exactly when their child boards or exits the vehicle.<br /><br />
      <strong>Instant Notifications</strong>
      Zidallie's intelligent notification system ensures that information about pickups, drop-offs, or delays is communicated promptly. This transparency reinforces trust and brings parents closer without the guessing game.<br /><br />
      <strong>Two-way Communication</strong>
      Parents can reach drivers or support teams directly via the Zidallie app for more direct and efficient communication lines in case of questions or emergencies.<br /><br />
      <strong>Custom Scheduling</strong>
      
      With the ability to tailor schedules and routes, parents can request accommodations that fit their family's needs to ensure convenience and consistency.<br /><br />

      <b>Hi Nelly, give us a short intro as to who you are and a bit about your background?</b><br />
      My name is Nelly Alili, my background is in software and business development but I also did a degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Science before this tech and business thing.<br /><br />
      During the Corona Virus period, it was pretty hard to get any jobs related to Biochemistry and Molecular Science so I started to look around for other options. Tech was being talked about everywhere so I though why not give it a try.<br /><br />
      At that same time, I also had an idea for a business that I wanted to start which would need tech to go along with it. The developers I approached to help build it were pretty expensive so I decided that I would to enroll for a software development bootcamp, learn Android development and build the first iteration of the application and that is what I did.<br /><br />
      I got into tech not to become a software engineer but more of as a means to an end, I wanted to start a business and my business would need an app to help it run smoothly.<br /><br />
      I am business first then tech, I like to say I am in the business with tech not in the tech business.<br /><br /><br />


      <b>What are you working on currently and how did the idea come up?</b><br />
      The motivation behind working on Zidallie is very personal. I have seen firsthand how it can be pretty hard for children especially special needs children to go to and from school, especially when the school doesnâ€™t have a school bus.<br /><br />
      They are usually packed and squeezed into 14 seater matatus or vans which do not even follow the guidelines required by the government when ferrying school children.<br /><br />
      I saw the problems the children and their parents were facing and thought this was something I could explore. Initially I wanted to buy a vehicle and do the business but then it occurred to me that if I wanted it to be bigger, scalable and more accessible, I should incorporate tech.<br /><br />
      Instead of buying vehicles I decided that it would be better to do an app that could connect people with the required vehicles to schools and parents who needed their kids ferried around safely and conveniently.<br /><br />
      So while I was enrolled at the software development bootcamp mentioned earlier, the final project that I did was what became Zidallie.<br /><br />
      After the bootcamp, I launched the app and put word out about the business and I got customers immediately. This made me see that it could really become something so I decided to completely focus on it and give it my all.<br /><br />
      This is how Zidallie came to be.<br /><br /><br />

      <b>What are your marketing strategies? How do you get customers?</b><br />
      The demographic I am serving is very rarely on social media. They are mostly of the older generation or people who have very little time for Tiktok and Instagram, social media in general. Parents and people who run schools.<br /><br />
      The best way for me to get clients has been through referrals.<br /><br />
      I pour my heart into my work when serving my existing clients because they are the ones who refer me to other clients.<br /><br />
      When a school recommends me to another school, itâ€™s a trusted referral and itâ€™s easier to onboard them as a client as compared to me going door to door trying to onboard with no prior connection or introduction.<br /><br />
      Trusted referrals have worked best for our business.<br /><br /><br />

      <b>How is Zidallie different from the competition, the other apps and websites in the same market as yourself?</b><br />
      From our research most of the apps/websites in the market are building school bus management systems, when in real senses there are very few school busses that need to be managed. Many schools donâ€™t have school busses or have just one or two.<br /><br />
      You cannot build tech for non-existent or insufficient infrastructure. The problem we are solving for is a lack of sufficient transport/school busses for schools in Kenya and Africa at large.<br /><br />
      We are filling this gap where there are few or no school busses in schools by giving parents a reliable alternative option, private and safe transport for their children to school, we are solving the infrastructure problem, the tech is an add on.<br /><br />
      My competitors are primarily the other transport options that parents are using, could be carpools or the usual matatu rides, towards this end our key advantages are timeliness, safety, properly vetted & trained personnel and good customer care. We give parents peace of mind.<br /><br /><br />

      <b>What are some challenges that you have faced and how did you overcome them?</b><br />
      Our biggest challenge has been meeting the demand for the services that we offer.<br /><br />
      There is a lot of demand as compared to the resources that we have at our disposal currently.<br /><br />
      For instance, vetting, hiring and training drivers can take a lot of time and can be resource intensive.<br /><br />
      At the moment, to overcome this, we try to onboard as many drivers as possible for the different routes that we serve so that we are always ready to handle any influx in transportation requirements.<br /><br />
      We have built a sustainable business and to grow further and manage such high demand we are now raising outside funding.<br /><br /><br />
      
      <b>Financially/user acquisition wise how is the business doing?</b><br />
      We like to measure our growth in terms of the number of children that we are able to get to school safely on a daily basis.<br /><br />
      Currently we transport more than 700 children to school on a daily basis in Nairobi.<br /><br />
      Considering that I started the business with Ksh. 30,000 back then, it still amazes me as to how far we have come. But we are still keen to grow even further.<br /><br /><br />
      
      <b>What would you say are some mistakes that you have made as a founder of a business?</b><br />
      While I was starting out I was very naÃ¯ve, I was too trusting towards people, I would sometimes not write contracts with people thinking that they would just pay as required, because why would someone not pay after you have done a good job for them.<br /><br />
      My biggest one would be that I trusted people too much.<br /><br />
      Hiring the wrong people is another one. I was not doing proper vetting when hiring people into the core team believing that they would work as hard as I do. People can teach you lessons and I definitely learned mine.<br /><br /><br />
      
      <b>If you had the chance to do things differently, what would you do?</b><br />
      Iâ€™m not sure if there is anything that I could have done different. There is no manual for building a business, sometimes things just happen and you have to deal with them head on as they come.<br /><br />
      You mainly just learn on the go, iterate and keep moving.<br /><br />
      Every mistake is a learning step for me.<br /><br /><br />
      
      <b>What are some of your future plans for the business?</b><br />
      We want to build a very inclusive platform for all children. This means that our business must also be able to cater to special needs children.<br /><br />
      Last year we served very few special needs children and we want to change that this year.<br /><br />
      Transport is a huge determinant as to whether a special needs child will get education or not. It can be quite hard even on the parents, we want our platform to help these parents as well.<br /><br />
      Our vehicles for special needs children have child minders to ensure that the children are well taken care of during their commute.<br /><br />
      We are also looking to expand to other cities and towns outside of Nairobi. The goal is to be able to transport 10,000 children to school and back home on a daily basis at some point in Zidallieâ€™s existence.<br /><br /><br />
      
      <b>What advice would you give to other African founders?</b><br />
      To focus on the customer whole heartedly. We have been able to bootstrap Zidallie to a place where the business is sustainable by simply focusing on giving great value to the customer.<br /><br />
      A business is supposed to be primarily funded by customers, practicing this has helped our business a lot and it can definitely help others as well.<br /><br /><br />
      
      <b>Any recommendations in terms of who to follow or a useful online resource?</b><br />
      My new obsession is female founders, it doesnâ€™t matter if they are in tech or skin care, Iâ€™ve mainly been trying to find female founders who are running successful businesses and whose values align with mine so I can learn from them.<br /><br />
      Iâ€™m still weighing my options on the ones to emulate.<br /><br /><br />
      
      <b>Getting personal, what does success look like to you as an individual and at what point would you say you have achieved said success?</b><br />
      When the business runs itself without me having to be there physically, that will be success.<br /><br />
      When I am able to separate from the business and it still runs successfully as intended.<br /><br /><br />
